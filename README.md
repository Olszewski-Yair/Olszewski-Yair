- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Olszewski-Yair!

I'm a Penetration Tester with a passion for cybersecurity research. After completing a Penetration Testesing course at ECOM, 
Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience working with tools like MSFConsole (Metasploit), Burp Suite, Wireshark, and Snort to uncover, exploit, and report vulnerabilities. 
My expertise includes testing and securing systems by identifying critical risks such as those outlined in the OWASP Top 10.

Iâ€™m always exploring new challenges in the world of cybersecurity and sharing my findings through research and practical solutions. 
On my GitHub, youâ€™ll find projects focused on penetration testing, vulnerability research, and improving security.

Let's connect and collaborate to make the digital world a safer place!
